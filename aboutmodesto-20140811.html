                <p>me, circa 5,000 years ago</p><br />
            <h4>Early Life (how it all began)</h4>
            <p>I as born in September 1996 in San Salvador, El Salvador, to a Salvadoran dad and an American mom. I lived in El Salvador for almost seven years, and as such , have many memories of it. My parents traveled around a lot, and always took me with them, so even as a baby, I was already experiencing many cultures. Mom always took me with her whenever she had to do any translations for delegations that came from the US, we traveled to Honduras several times, and lived for my first four years in the countryside, and for the last two that I was there, we lived in a small city in the northern mountains of El Salvador. I went to first kinder and  dabbled a little bit in first grade while living in El Salvador, but then I decided to wait until we came up to the US (mom wanted to return to the US for my schooling) before going on to first grade.</p><br />
            <h4>Elementary School (boring part, part 1)</h4>
            <p>We moved up to Albuquerque from El Salvador a month before my birthday, because that is when registration was, and I was of age to be registered into first grade. I went to a dual language elementary school, and was there for four and a half years. The first three years, we had a really good principal. However, he left the school, and everything went downhill. The new principal wasn't good, and the school really suffered. He only lasted two years, before he was either forced to quit or was fired by APS, I don't know which one. In fifth, the new principal was also bad, and when I had problems with one of the teachers, he refused to give that teacher a black mark on their record because the teacher was his senior and had never received any black marks on their records and he wasn't gonna be the first to give them one. So mom puled me out, and home schooled me for the last half of fifth. during this period, I visited El Salvador at least once a year.</p><br />
            <h4>Middle School(boring part, part 2)</h4>
            <p>I got a scholarship at a private school, and went there for all of middle school. Although the education was good in sixth grade in most aspects, it started deteriorating each grade, until eigth grade the only really good classes (in my opinion) were math, science, some parts of english, and PE. Sixth Grade was the last time I was able to go to El Salvador, before the fare got too expensive.</p> <br />
            <h4>High School (where I learn to fight...)</h4>
            <p>I started high school here in AHS, however I only went for half a year. In January of 2012, my family and I moved to Nicaragua. I finished freshmen year online, while taking sophomore in Nicaragua. There, even though I was Salvadoran, they didn't accept me, because they are weary of outsiders. It didn't help my case that I had inherited my mom's white skin, which made me a target of ridicule as well. I'd been bullied as a kid, because I neverreally fit in (in El Salvador because of my skin color, in elementary school, because I was Salvadoran and not Mexican or American, and in middle school because I had a different outlook on life than a lot of my peers), so I was used to ridicule, but everybody has their limit. The second year, junior year, I got into several fights with fellow classmates, which if you ask any of my friends who knew me before Nicaragua, would tell you was very unusual for me. Now, while I'd still rather talk something out than fight, I wont back down from a fight. And as I soon found out, that didn't just mean physical fights. sometimes punches do less damage than words.</p> <br />
            <h4>GED and beyond (...and end up dropping out)</h4>
            <p>halfway through Junior year, I went to visit my grandmothe in Vermont. I ended up dropping out of high school in Nicaragua and staying with her to get my GED and go to the community college there. everything went well at first, however, halfway through my time there, things started to get sour. first, I was feeling lonely. I was not used to the cold, so I didn't go out much, and even when I did, I didn't find anyone who was my age. So I was feeling lonely. Then, three quarters of the way through my visit, things went south- fast. long story short, I ended up fighting with my grandmother a lot for the duration of my stay.</p><br />
            <h4>Return To Albuquerque (in which I make new friends and visit old friends and find a certain coding camp)</h4>
            <p>I returned to Albuquerque, and made various visits to different friends, and also made new ones through a camp called Camp Rising Sun (I was a CIT and Peer Camper there). I was originally gonna work and take classes at CNM, but then I found out about this coding boot camp, and decided come to it and forget about college.</p> <br />
